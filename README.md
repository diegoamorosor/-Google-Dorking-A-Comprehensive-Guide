# Google Dorking: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to learning everything about **Google Dorking**, a powerful technique for extracting specific information using search engines. This document is designed for educational purposes and cybersecurity awareness.

---

## üìñ What is Google Dorking?

**Google Dorking** (or Google Hacking) is a technique that uses advanced search operators in search engines, like Google, to locate sensitive information that might have been unintentionally exposed online. This includes:

- Confidential files.
- Pages with login credentials.
- Server configurations.
- Exposed network devices.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Google Dorking must be used ethically and legally. Improper use may lead to severe consequences.

## üõ† Basic Search Operators

| **Operator**    | **Description**                                        | **Example**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `site:`         | Limits results to a specific domain.                  | `site:example.com`                  |
| `intitle:`      | Searches for keywords in the page title.              | `intitle:"login"`                   |
| `inurl:`        | Searches for keywords in the URL.                     | `inurl:"admin"`                     |
| `filetype:`     | Searches for specific file types.                     | `filetype:pdf "confidential"`       |
| `ext:`          | Short version of `filetype:`.                         | `ext:docx "password"`               |
| `cache:`        | Displays the cached version of a page.                | `cache:example.com`                 |
| `" "`           | Matches an exact phrase.                              | `"index of /"`                      |

## üîç Common Google Dorking Examples

- Find exposed configuration files:

```text
  filetype:env "DB_PASSWORD"
```

- List open directories:
    
    ```text
    intitle:"index of" "parent directory"
    ```
    
- Search for accessible IP cameras:
    
    ```text
    inurl:"/view/index.shtml"
    ```
    
- Credentials on GitHub:
    
    ```text
    site:github.com "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```

## üõ° Prevention Measures

To protect your assets from Google Dorking:

1. **Configure robots.txt**: Limit search engines' access to sensitive areas of your website.
2. **Avoid posting sensitive data online**: Never publish credentials or configuration files in public repositories.
3. **Use vulnerability scanners**: Regularly audit your assets to identify exposed data.
4. **Set proper permissions**: Protect sensitive directories and files with passwords or restricted access.
5. **Monitor your online presence**: Use tools like Google Alerts to detect exposed data.
